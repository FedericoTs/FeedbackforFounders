# Feedback Platform - Feedback Page PRD

## 1. Overview

The Feedback Page is the core component of our platform, enabling users to provide contextual feedback on websites and startup ideas while ensuring a seamless, intuitive experience. This document outlines the design, functionality, and implementation details for creating an effective feedback collection system that benefits both feedback providers and project owners.

## 2. Goals & Success Metrics

### Primary Goals
- Enable precise, context-specific feedback on different sections of websites/products
- Create an engaging, intuitive feedback process with minimal friction
- Provide meaningful rewards through the points system
- Generate highly structured, actionable insights for project owners
- Maximize feedback quality through AI-assisted classification and moderation

### Success Metrics
- Average feedback completion rate > 85%
- Feedback specificity score (measuring how targeted/contextual feedback is) > 8/10
- Project owner satisfaction with feedback quality > 90%
- Average time to complete feedback < 4 minutes
- Feedback provider return rate > 60%

## 3. User Experience Flow

### 3.1 Entry Points
- From Discovery page after clicking "Give Feedback" on a project card
- From direct link shared by project owner
- After using points to "unlock" premium feedback opportunities

### 3.2 Session Initialization
1. User lands on a welcome screen showing project basic info and feedback rules
2. Brief explanation of the points system and rewards for quality feedback
3. One-click entry to begin the feedback session

### 3.3 Core Feedback Flow

#### Viewing Content Within Platform Frame
- Project website loads in a secure iframe occupying 80% of screen width
- Platform header remains visible with project name, feedback progress, and exit button
- Persistent sidebar (collapsible) shows feedback structure and progress

#### Section-Based Feedback Approach

Instead of direct element selection (which proved problematic), we implement a "Section-Based Feedback" system:

1. **AI-Powered Section Detection**
   - Upon loading, our AI (leveraging GPT models) analyzes the website and identifies logical sections (header, hero section, features, pricing, etc.)
   - Each section is assigned a unique identifier and visual indicator

2. **Visual Navigation Map**
   - A minimap in the sidebar shows all detected sections
   - Hovering over a section in the minimap highlights the corresponding area on the website
   - Sections are color-coded based on feedback coverage (no feedback, partial feedback, complete feedback)

3. **Feedback Collection**
   - User clicks on a section in the minimap to focus on that area
   - The corresponding website section is highlighted with a semi-transparent overlay
   - A feedback panel slides in from the right with contextual prompts:
     - "What do you think about this [section type]?"
     - "How would you improve this [section type]?"
     - Pre-populated category tags based on the section (UX, copy, visual design, etc.)

4. **Visual Reference Capture**
   - Instead of pinpointing specific elements, users can capture a screenshot of the current view
   - Screenshot tool allows basic annotations (circles, arrows, highlights)
   - Annotated screenshots are automatically attached to feedback

5. **Section Progress Tracking**
   - Visual indicators show which sections have received feedback
   - A progress bar tracks overall feedback completion

### 3.4 Alternative: Topic-Based Feedback Mode

For users who prefer a more structured approach:

1. User selects "Topic-Based Feedback" mode
2. Platform presents pre-defined topics based on AI analysis of the website:
   - Navigation & Information Architecture
   - Visual Design & Branding
   - Content & Messaging
   - Functionality & Features
   - User Experience & Flow
   - Business Model & Value Proposition
3. For each topic, the AI presents relevant questions and screenshots of applicable website sections
4. Users provide feedback on topics that interest them, with progress tracking

### 3.5 Quick Reaction Layer

Complementing the detailed feedback:

- Floating reaction bar allows quick sentiment indicators on any section
- Emoji reactions (confused üòï, impressed üòÆ, concerned üò¨, delighted üòç)
- Quick issue flags (broken functionality, typo, confusing element)
- These micro-feedbacks supplement detailed comments and improve engagement

### 3.6 Feedback Submission & Rewards

1. Upon completion, the system shows a feedback summary
2. AI analysis provides immediate quality score based on:
   - Specificity and actionability
   - Comprehensiveness
   - Novelty compared to existing feedback
   - Constructiveness of criticism
3. Points are awarded according to the gamification system rules:
   - Base points (10) for feedback submission
   - Quality multipliers based on AI analysis (up to 2x each factor)
   - Bonus points for section coverage
   - Maximum cap of 50 points per feedback
4. User sees points earned with explanation via the AwardToast notification system
5. Achievement badges unlocked are displayed (Feedback Champion, Quality Reviewer, etc.)
6. Activity is recorded in the user's activity feed
7. Option to share on social media with templated message about contribution

## 4. Technical Implementation

### 4.1 Website Rendering & Section Mapping

```sql
Framework: Secure iframe with post-message communication
Security: Content Security Policy restrictions
Performance: Progressive loading of sections
Compatibility: Browser detection with fallback display modes
```

### 4.2 AI Section Detection Algorithm

```sql
Input: Website HTML structure, visual rendering
Process:
1. HTML semantic analysis (headers, divs, sections)
2. Visual boundary detection
3. Content clustering
4. Section type classification
Output: Section map with boundaries, types, and relevance scores
```

### 4.3 Feedback Data Structure

```sql
-- Enhanced Feedback Table
CREATE TABLE feedback (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  project_id UUID REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  section_id TEXT NOT NULL, -- Maps to detected section
  section_name TEXT NOT NULL, -- Human-readable section description
  section_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- Category of section (hero, pricing, etc.)
  content TEXT NOT NULL, -- The actual feedback text
  sentiment FLOAT, -- AI-analyzed sentiment (-1 to 1)
  category TEXT NOT NULL, -- Primary feedback category
  subcategory TEXT, -- More specific categorization
  actionability_score FLOAT, -- AI-determined actionability 0-1
  specificity_score FLOAT, -- How specific the feedback is 0-1
  novelty_score FLOAT, -- How unique compared to other feedback 0-1
  helpfulness_rating INTEGER, -- Owner rating of feedback usefulness
  screenshot_url TEXT,
  screenshot_annotations JSON, -- Stored annotations data
  quick_reactions JSON, -- Emoji reactions data
  points_awarded INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Section Mapping Table
CREATE TABLE project_sections (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  project_id UUID REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  section_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  section_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  section_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  dom_path TEXT, -- Path to section in DOM
  visual_bounds JSON, -- Visual coordinates on page
  priority INTEGER, -- Importance of section
  feedback_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  average_sentiment FLOAT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(project_id, section_id)
);
```

### 4.4 Points Calculation Algorithm

```sql
Base points: 10 points per feedback submission
Quality multipliers:
- Specificity: 0.5-2x based on specificity_score
- Actionability: 0.5-2x based on actionability_score
- Comprehensiveness: 0.5-2x based on length and detail
- Novelty: 0.5-2x based on uniqueness vs. existing feedback

Decay formula for similar feedback:
points = base_points * (1 - (similarity_score * 0.8))

Cap: Maximum 50 points per feedback
Bonus: +5 points for each section covered beyond minimum
```

### 4.5 GPT Integration for Feedback Analysis

```sql
Model: GPT-3.5-turbo for real-time analysis
Tasks:
1. Section detection and classification
2. Feedback quality assessment
3. Sentiment analysis
4. Category prediction
5. Similarity detection
6. Actionability scoring

Custom prompt template:
"Analyze this feedback: [feedback]. Rate specificity (0-1), actionability (0-1), sentiment (-1 to 1), and classify into categories. Compare with existing feedback summary: [summary] and rate novelty (0-1)."
```
