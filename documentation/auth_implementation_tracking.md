## Notes

- The auth audit script successfully identified all components using useAuth
- All storyboard components are already properly wrapped with StoryboardAuthWrapper
- The withAuth HOC is now available for use in isolated components
- Documentation has been updated with comprehensive examples of HOC usage
- Test storyboards have been created to verify both wrapping approaches (StoryboardAuthWrapper and withAuth HOC)
- The SessionManagement component has been successfully tested in a storyboard environment
- Secure token storage implementation uses Web Crypto API with AES-GCM encryption
- Device fingerprinting is used to generate encryption keys that are specific to the user's browser/device
- Token integrity is verified using SHA-256 hashing to detect tampering
- Token expiration is now checked when retrieving tokens
- Enhanced token refresh mechanism with automatic retry on failure
- Added ability to sign out from all devices
- Updated AuthProvider to use the secure token storage system
- Created a demo storyboard to test and demonstrate the secure token storage functionality
- Fixed issues with sessionInfo and related functions in AuthProvider
- Implemented session validity checking and time remaining display
- Created a new session management demo storyboard to test the functionality
- Fixed Fast Refresh compatibility issue with useAuth hook export
- Fixed syntax error in App.tsx with missing closing tag
- Created ApplicationStoryboard.tsx to properly wrap the application with BrowserRouter
