# Authentication Implementation Fixes

## Overview

This document outlines the fixes implemented to address authentication-related issues in the application, particularly focusing on the proper usage of `useAuth`, `AuthProvider`, `withAuth`, and `StoryboardAuthWrapper`.

## Issues Addressed

1. **Duplicate Export in StoryboardAuthWrapper**
   - Fixed the duplicate export issue in `StoryboardAuthWrapper.tsx` by removing the named export and keeping only the default export.

2. **Syntax Error in App.tsx**
   - Fixed a missing closing bracket in the `Suspense` component in `App.tsx`.

3. **Inconsistent Auth Provider Wrapping**
   - Ensured all dashboard pages are properly wrapped with the `withAuth` HOC.
   - Verified that all storyboard components using `useAuth` are properly wrapped with `StoryboardAuthWrapper`.

## Implementation Details

### 1. StoryboardAuthWrapper Fix

The `StoryboardAuthWrapper` component had both a named export and a default export of the same component, causing a "Duplicate export" error. This was fixed by removing the named export and keeping only the default export.

```tsx
// Before
export function StoryboardAuthWrapper() { ... }
export default StoryboardAuthWrapper;

// After
function StoryboardAuthWrapper() { ... }
export default StoryboardAuthWrapper;
```

### 2. App.tsx Fix

The `App.tsx` file had a syntax error with a missing closing bracket in the `Suspense` component. This was fixed by adding the missing bracket.

```tsx
// Before
<Suspense fallback={<p>Loading...</p>}
  <ErrorBoundary>
    <AppRoutes />
  </ErrorBoundary>
</Suspense>

// After
<Suspense fallback={<p>Loading...</p>}>
  <ErrorBoundary>
    <AppRoutes />
  </ErrorBoundary>
</Suspense>
```

### 3. Dashboard Pages Fix

All dashboard pages were verified to be properly wrapped with the `withAuth` HOC to ensure they have access to the authentication context.

```tsx
import withAuth from "@/lib/withAuth";

function DashboardPage() { ... }

export default withAuth(DashboardPage);
```

## Best Practices

1. **Using useAuth**
   - Always ensure components using `useAuth` are descendants of an `AuthProvider`.
   - For isolated components, use the `withAuth` HOC to wrap them with `AuthProvider`.

2. **Storyboard Components**
   - Always wrap storyboard components with `StoryboardAuthWrapper` if they use `useAuth`.
   - Use the `useMockAuth` prop to provide mock authentication data for testing.

3. **Export/Import Consistency**
   - Be consistent with exports. If a component is exported as default, import it as default.
   - Avoid duplicate exports of the same component.

## Verification

All components using `useAuth` have been verified to be properly wrapped with either `AuthProvider`, `withAuth`, or `StoryboardAuthWrapper`. The application now loads without authentication-related errors.
